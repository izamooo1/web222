A responsive design is when a web developer codes in a very specific and unique way the web application that can handle the dynamic changes of itself. For example, the windows, that make it easier for the user to use. Responsive design is also when I code a website, with a big or large image on it and it’s easier to use with a mouse but when I try to use it with something else, for example, a phone, a tablet, or even a tv; it’ll be hard to use or even disabled. That’s why responsive web design is very helpful nowadays. Another example is adding animations to some applications, they might look animated on a phone, but they might be disabled in a computer and start looking like an image, or vice versa. Also, in my opinion, I think that using a responsive design for a web application is a little complicated but worth it in every single aspect, You have to make sure that your code works properly on every device and that might ruin the way that you code some stuff that looks good on a computer.
In this course, I learned a lot, starting from JavaScript to CSS and HTML. Something that helped a lot during this project was this google feature called the Toggle device toolbar, which helps me to see how my webpage is going to look on any other device, and that’s how we can tell if a web application is responsive or not. My experience in this course overcome the expectations I had from it, I always wanted to be a web developer, but I never thought I would learn that much from a second-level course. I can’t imagine what else am I going to learn from the next semester’s course. At first, it was hard how to introduce JavaScript into HTML but after a few projects I realized it was really easy and super helpful, the things that we can do on a web application are unlimited. This was my first time learning Web development and I’m really happy that I was able to get into this class, This has made me realize that I would love to keep doing this for a long time. With all the knowledge that I acquired during this 12 weeks I consider that I got enough knowledge to start making my own projects and start acquiring more on my own.
